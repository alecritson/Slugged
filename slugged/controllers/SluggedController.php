/**
 * Business Logic Controller
 *
 * Controller methods get a little more complicated... There are several ways to access them:
 *
 *     1. Submitting a form can trigger a controller action.
 *     2. Using an AJAX request can trigger a controller action.
 *     3. Routing to an action URL will trigger a controller action.
 *
 * A controller can do many things, but be wary... If your logic gets too complex, you may want
 * to off-load much of it to the Service file.

	 *     $.post('actions/businessLogic/exampleAjax' ...
	 *
	 * Or if your plugin is doing something within the control panel,

	 *     Craft.postActionRequest('businessLogic/exampleAjax' ...
